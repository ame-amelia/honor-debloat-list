# Honor Debloat List

A lazily annotated list of apps to debloat on Honor phones, in the same format as the Universal Debloat Lists (ng) used by apps like Canta and De-Bloater.

The annotations came from word of mouth from users on the XDA Forum, Reddit, etc., with little testing on my end (besides the stylus and wireless mirroring features), so take this information with a grain of salt.

PR if you feel like it.
